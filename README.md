# Auctions
This was a group project for the course "Multi-agent Systems".
Î¤he implementation of this project was made in Java, but we also made use of the JADE platform.
For each protocol, we implemented an auction system with three participants; an Auctioneer and two Bidders.
The protocols that we implented were the First-price sealed-bid, the Second-price sealed-bid and the English protocol.
